**Project Description**

The Coffee Shop POS System is designed to streamline menu management, order processing, and billing for Hell Week Coffee. It supports diverse items like drinks, food, and merchandise, with features tailored for different user roles. Admins create Manager and Cashier accounts, Managers handle item encoding via Postman, and Cashiers process orders through a GUI, printing receipts for transactions. Customers can order as guests or members using a unique ID for rewards. Built with React (Frontend), Spring and Java (Backend), and PostgreSQL (Database), the system combines user-friendly interfaces and efficient workflows to optimize coffee shop operations.
